Did this, to demonstrate problem with loading native libraries with sbt.
If you comment out System.gc(); from HelloMain and repeatedly run the app from SBT console, you will get  -
"java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library /home/alvar/devel/jni/c/hello.so already loaded in another classloader" error.
However, when you compile with System.gc(); commented in, everything works fine.


javac Hello.java
javah -classpath . -o ../c/Hello.h Hello
rm Hello.class
cc -c -fPIC -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/include/linux hello.c -o hello.o
cc -shared -o hello.so hello.o
cd java
sbt
